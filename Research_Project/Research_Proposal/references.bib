  abstract  = {Recently, we have seen a boom of attempts to improve the operation of networking protocols using machine learning techniques. The proposed reinforcement learning (RL) based control solutions very often overtake traditionally designed ones in terms of performance and efficiency. However, in order to reach such a superb level, an RL control agent requires a lot of interactions with an environment to learn the best policies. Similarly, the recent advancements in image recognition area were enabled by the rise of large labeled datasets (e.g. ImageNet). This paper presents the ns3-gym - the first framework for RL research in networking. It is based on OpenAI Gym, a toolkit for RL research and ns-3 network simulator. Specifically, it allows representing an ns-3 simulation as an environment in Gym framework and exposing state and control knobs of entities from the simulation for the agent's learning purposes. Our framework is generic and can be used in various networking problems. Here, we present an illustrative example from the cognitive radio area, where a wireless node learns the channel access pattern of a periodic interferer in order to avoid collisions with it. The toolkit is provided to the community as open-source under a GPL license.},

abstract = {The forthcoming 6G wireless networks have great potential for establishing AI-based networks that can enhance end-to-end connection and manage massive data of real-time networks. Artificial Intelligence (AI) advancements have contributed to the development of several innovative technologies by providing sophisticated specific AI mathematical models such as machine learning models, deep learning models, and hybrid models. Furthermore, intelligent resource management allows for self-configuration and autonomous decision-making capabilities of AI methods, which in turn improves the performance of 6G networks. Hence, 6G networks rely substantially on AI methods to manage resources. This paper comprehensively surveys the recent work of AI methods-based resource management for 6G networks. Firstly, the AI methods are categorized into Deep Learning (DL), Federated Learning (FL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Evolutionary Learning (EL). Then, we analyze the AI approaches according to optimization issues such as user association, channel allocation, power allocation, and mode selection. Thereafter, we provide appropriate solutions to the most significant problems with the existing approaches of AI-based resource management. Finally, various open issues and potential trends related to AI-based resource management applications are presented. In summary, this survey enables researchers to understand these advancements thoroughly and quickly identify remaining challenges that need further investigation.}

  abstractnote = { The integration of artificial intelligence into network management has become a subject of increasing interest and importance in the field of information technology.[1] This research paper aims to examine the application of AI techniques in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of network management, including areas such as dynamic resource allocation, fault detection and diagnosis, and security enhancement. The paper reviews existing literature on the applications of AI in network management, highlighting the potential benefits and challenges associated with this integration. The rapid growth of wireless networks and the increasing complexity of network infrastructure have posed significant challenges for traditional network management approaches. AI-driven techniques have shown promising results in addressing these challenges, with the ability to process large amounts of data, learn from past experiences, and make real-time decisions. [2] This paper explores the various AI algorithms and models that have been applied to network management, such as machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, and discusses their impact on network performance, security, and resource optimization. [3] The integration of AI in network management has the potential to revolutionize the way networks are designed, configured, and maintained, offering several key benefits: Improved Resource Utilization and Optimization: AI algorithms can analyze network traffic patterns, user behavior, and resource availability to optimize the allocation of network resources, such as bandwidth, computing power, and storage, leading to more efficient use of network infrastructure. Enhanced Fault Detection and Diagnosis: AI-based models can quickly identify and diagnose network faults, enabling faster response times and minimizing service disruptions, which is crucial for maintaining reliable network operations.[4] Increased Network Security: AI techniques can be employed to detect and mitigate cyber threats, such as network intrusions, malware, and distributed denial-of-service attacks, by analyzing network traffic and behavioral patterns, strengthening the overall security posture of the network.[5] Adaptive Network Configuration and Optimization: AI-driven network management systems can continuously monitor the network and adjust configurations in real-time to adapt to changing conditions, such as fluctuations in user demand or network topology changes, ensuring optimal network performance.[6]  Despite the promising potential of AI in network management, the integration of these technologies also presents several challenges, including the need for robust data collection and preprocessing, the complexity of AI models, and the potential for unexpected AI-driven behavior.[7] This research paper provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI-driven network management, highlighting the key benefits, challenges, and future research directions.
